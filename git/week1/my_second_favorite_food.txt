Ukrainian Syrniki Recipe

Syrniki Ingredients:

* Farmer’s Cheese Recipe (Tvorog) – when looking for the best cheese to make syrniki look for a well drained farmer’s cheese with not a lot of whey. If the cheese you do have has a lot of weigh, just line a sieve with a paper towel, add the cheese and allow the extra whey to drip off. The farmer’s cheese will sometimes go under the name of Amish cheese or tvorog, depending on where you’re located.

* If tvorog or farmer’s cheese is not sold locally, you can always make your own tvorog using only milk and buttermilk.

* Flour – you can use either semolina or all-purpose flour this recipe. Using one or the other will have an effect on texture though. Try it both ways and pick your favorite.

* Eggs – eggs are used as one of the binding ingredients in this recipe. Regular large-sized eggs are all you need.
