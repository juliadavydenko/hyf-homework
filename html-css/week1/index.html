        <p><em>Localization and transcreation services <strong> <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/juliadavydenko/hyf-homework/blob/main/html-css/week1/index.html">for IT companies</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I have been working with several companies from Ukrainian media market, specializing in dubbing, subtitling and adaptation (Inter Media Group, TakTreba Production, 1+1).
          I have experience in translating, editing and adaptation (lip sync) texts
          for Voice Over and Subtitles.
          Due to successful completion of my latest projects as an IT translating and adaptation specialist I am open to new projects.
          I can help you with translations and adaptations English-Ukrainian-Russian (EN-UA-RU). I'm using English sources and have
          8 years of experience in adaptation slang, idioms and informal expressions.
          My areas of interest: languages, education, technology, so projects I work on are usually based on those three main interests.
          I have been working in Educational field for more than 3 years now.
          I have excellent PC skills and I have basic knowledge of HTML/CSS.
          I used to work with Miro, Oneskypeapp and Notion while managing my projects. </p>
